"""Shared WordPress -> Markdown conversion, used by both properties.

The two properties are two repositories now, and the Discovery one carries a
copy of this file, kept identical by hand: a fix to the Gutenberg handling has
to land in both.

Discovery's wiki articles and the main site's news posts come out of the same
Gutenberg editor and share the same three problems, so the block splitting,
the <pre> unwrapping and the inline conversion live here rather than being
written twice:

  1. Code blocks come in three shapes, not one:
         <pre class="wp-block-code"><code>one line</code></pre>
         <pre class="wp-block-preformatted">no code element at all<br></pre>
         <pre><code><code>nested</code><br><code>code elements</code></code></pre>
  2. Multi-line commands are joined with <br>, not newlines. Convert naively and
     every multi-line shell snippet collapses onto one line -- and they are not
     only in <pre>: a paragraph's <code> carries them too, where the line break
     is all that separates one command from the next.
  3. Nothing carries a language, so code blocks would render unhighlighted.
     Languages are inferred from the first token.

What differs between the two properties is what an embed, an image and a link
should become -- Starlight wants a <YouTube> component, assets in the wiki's
own tree and cross-references rewritten to the new URLs, the news importer
wants downloaded assets -- so those three are callbacks, not policy baked in
here. A fourth, on_gallery, is opt-in: unset, a gallery stays the run of images
it has always been, which is all a Markdown news post can render anyway.
